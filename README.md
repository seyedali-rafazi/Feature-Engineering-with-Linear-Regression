# Feature-Engineering-with-Linear-Regression
This repository contains code for performing feature engineering and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on machine learning datasets.

Feature engineering is the process of creating new features from existing ones. This can be done to improve the performance of machine learning models by making them more informative and less noisy.

EDA is the process of exploring and understanding data. This can be done by visualizing the data, calculating summary statistics, and identifying patterns.

The following are some of the techniques covered in this repository:

> 1. Simple EDA 
> 2. One-hot Encoding variables
> 3. Log transformation for skewed variables
> 4. Pair plot for features
> 5. Basic feature engineering: adding polynomial and interaction terms
> 6. Feature engineering: categories and features derived from category aggregates 

To use the code, simply clone the repository and install the dependencies. Then, you can run the notebooks to perform feature engineering and EDA on your own datasets.
