# Feature-Engineering-with-Linear-Regression
This repository contains code for performing feature engineering and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on machine learning datasets.

Feature engineering is the process of creating new features from existing ones. This can be done to improve the performance of machine learning models by making them more informative and less noisy.

EDA is the process of exploring and understanding data. This can be done by visualizing the data, calculating summary statistics, and identifying patterns.

The following are some of the techniques covered in this repository:

> 1.Simple EDA: This includes techniques such as plotting histograms, boxplots, and correlation matrices.
> 2.One-hot encoding: This is a technique for converting categorical variables into numerical variables.
> 3.Log transformation: This is a technique for transforming skewed numerical variables into more normally distributed variables.
> 4.Pair plot: This is a type of scatter plot that shows the relationships between all pairs of features in a dataset.
> 5.Basic feature engineering: This includes techniques such as adding polynomial and interaction terms to features.
> 6.Feature engineering: categories and features derived from category aggregates: This includes techniques such as creating features that represent the number of categories in a categorical variable or the average value of a numerical variable within each category.
> 7.This repository is intended to be a starting point for learning about feature engineering and EDA. The code is well-documented and easy to follow.

To use the code, simply clone the repository and install the dependencies. Then, you can run the notebooks to perform feature engineering and EDA on your own datasets.
